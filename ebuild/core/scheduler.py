"""Concurrent execution of a dependency graph.

``topological_sort`` yields a single sequence, so building in that order
serialises work that has no relationship. ``run_graph`` keeps the same
guarantee — a node starts only once its dependencies have finished — while
running independent nodes at the same time.

The schedule is dynamic rather than level-by-level: a node becomes eligible as
soon as its own dependencies complete, instead of waiting for every other node
at the same depth.
